# krisis-money

This project is a birth of like 6 hours of meddling around with my puter
not my best work but somewhat useful thigamajig

this app is made to be connected to apple icloud. why? that will be because of the fact that this app can be used side by side with the apple shortcut app
at least that was what this app was meant to be.

## sylabus
1. income.csv
   this be the folder where your money is before they run away from you. this can be altered manually by appending some amount of money under the list. but if you dont want to be bothered by it, the python app and the shortcut app can mediate this function.
3. spending.csv
   as the name suggests, this logs your usage of money. the formating would be (dd/MM//yy, %H:%M, Amount, Type)
## how to:
1. put the main folder inside icloud drive
2. add the shortcut file to shortcuts app
3. modify the shortcut to read income and append the spending to income and spending file from the icloud drive. show them the way (type the directory)
4. should work properly just by doing allat. app kinda wonky but hey it works
